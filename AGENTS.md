# Sub-Agent Tracking

## Overview
This file tracks any sub-agents spawned during development of blueteeth.

## Active Agents
None currently active.

## Planned Agents
If the main implementation becomes complex, we may spawn specialized agents:

1. **bluetooth-agent**: Handle bluetoothctl interactions and D-Bus communication
2. **pipewire-agent**: Manage PipeWire audio routing and profile switching
3. **gui-agent**: Implement optional GUI/tray interface

## Agent Communication
Agents will communicate progress via:
- Updates to this file
- Git commits with descriptive messages
- Comments in code for handoff points
